# Colonel Kurtz

A block editor. Supports nested data structures.

Pardon the dust. This is very in development, and very not ready for any type of use right now.

## Setup

```bash
npm install -d
npm start
```

## Configuration

All environment variables should go in `.env`. This file is loaded in on boot, but existing variables will persist. For example:

`NODE_ENV=production PORT=4000 npm start`

Would start the server in production mode on port `4000`, instead of `3000`.
